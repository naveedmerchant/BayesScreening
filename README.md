# BayesScreening package Package


## Introduction

BayesScreening is an R package for screening important variables for data sets with large amounts of predictors. The screening is primarily intended for classification. It does this by applying Bayesian tests that check if two or more samples have the same distribution. There are also other screening methods to compare these methods to in the package.
