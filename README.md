# BayesScreening package Package


## Introduction

BayesScreening is an R package for screening important variables for data sets with large amounts of predictors. The screening is primarily intended for classification. It does this by applying Bayesian tests that check if two or more samples have the same distribution. There are also other screening methods to compare these methods to in this package.

The bayesian tests themselves can also be used to get an idea for what the distribution of the data looks like. Intended users are people that either want to use the screening methods, want to use the tests to check if the distributions are the same, or are people that want to see bayesian predictive posteriors that estimate the distribution of the data under few assumptions.
