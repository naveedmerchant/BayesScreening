\usage{
ParScreenVars(
  datasetX,
  datasetY,
  method = "SIS",
  ncores = 1,
  cutoff = NULL,
  train1ids = NULL,
  trainsize1 = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{datasetX}{A matrix containing values that are predictors for the Y values}

\item{datasetY}{A vector containg the class that each predictor corresponds to. For now can only handle binary responses.}

\item{method}{A string containing the type of screening to do. Can be "SIS", "KS", "CVBF" or "PT"}

\item{ncores}{A integer that corresponds to the number of cores to be used for parallelizing computation}

\item{cutoff}{A real number that corresponds either to an alpha value for testing or a cutoff value on how large the Bayes factor needs to be to conclude a difference exists.}

\item{train1ids}{A vector of ids that correspond to which observations to use for the training set for the first data set}

\item{trainsize1}{Size of the training set for one of the classes for CVBF}

\item{trainsize2}{Size of the training set for the other one of the classes for CVBF}

\item{train2ids}{A vector of ids that correspond to which observations to use for the training set for the second data set}

\item{seed}{A seed for CVBF based screening, can use this to reproduce results instead of train_ids.}

\item{Ginv}{A function to compute quantiles with for Polya tree.}

\item{c}{Tuning parameter for Polya tree, signifies how impactful prior should be.}

\item{leveltot}{Depth of Polya tree to construct if Polya tree based screening is type of screening chosen}

\item{PTscale}{A True / false variable. Should columns be standardized before proceeding with Polya tree based screening? Default is to screen as recommended by authors.}
